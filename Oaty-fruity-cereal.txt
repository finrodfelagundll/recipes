Ingredients:

CEREAL
100 g dried fruit, such as sultanas, raisins, dried apricots
50 g mixed unsalted nuts, such as almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts
50 g mixed seeds, such as pumpkin, sunflower, sesame, poppy
400 g porridge oats
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon , optional
milk or natural yoghur , to serve
BIRCHER (SERVES 4)
1 eating apple
roughly 400 ml milk

Method:

To make the basic cereal, roughly chop any larger dried fruit
and nuts, then place into a large bowl along with the seeds,
oats and cinnamon (if using).
Tip into an airtight container.
Now you have two choices. To serve your cereal as it is, place
a handful of cereal (roughly 50g) per person into your serving
bowls.
Add milk or natural yoghurt and chopped fresh fruit, if you like,
then serve.
To make bircher muesli for 4 people, add 200g of the cereal
to a large bowl.
Place a box grater on a board, then coarsely grate the apple,
discarding the core. Add it to your oaty cereal.
Pour over enough milk to cover, then mix well.
Cover the bowl with clingfilm, then pop in the fridge to
soak overnight.
When youâ€™re ready to eat, give the bircher a good stir,
divide between your bowls, then serve with chopped fresh fruit,
if you like.
